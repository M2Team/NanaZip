# NanaZip Platform User Library (K7User)

***Work In Progress***

The static and dynamic library that encapsulates the GUI portion of the base
platform infrastructure for the NanaZip. It's one of the foundational libraries
of the NanaZip Platform Abstraction Layer.

K7 is the alias of NanaZip. Here is the relationship between K7 and NanaZip: I
had mentioned one of the reasons that I call this project NanaZip because Nana
is the romaji of なな which means seven in Japanese. But I had not mentioned the
way I confirm that: I had recalled one of the Japanese VTubers called Kagura
Nana when I waiting my elder sister for dinner at Taiyanggong subway station,
Beijing. For playing more puns, NanaZip uses the K7 (K -> Kagura, 7 -> Nana) as
the alias.

K7User is designed for Windows only, although the most of the K7User interfaces
are designed to be platform-independent. Maybe in the future, the K7User will
have the implementations for Linux and FreeBSD, although the implementation may
not in this repository.
