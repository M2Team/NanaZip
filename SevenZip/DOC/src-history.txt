HISTORY of the 7-Zip source code
--------------------------------

21.02 alpha    2021-05-06
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now writes additional field for filename in UTF-8 encoding to zip archives.
  It allows to extract correct file name from zip archives on different systems.
- The command line version of 7-Zip for macOS was released.
- The speed for LZMA and LZMA2 decompression in arm64 versions for macOS and Linux 
  was increased by 20%-60%.
- Some changes and improvements in ZIP, TAR and NSIS code.


21.01 alpha    2021-03-09
-------------------------
- The command line version of 7-Zip for Linux was released.
- The improvements for speed of ARM64 version using hardware CPU instructions 
  for AES, CRC-32, SHA-1 and SHA-256.
- The bug in versions 18.02 - 21.00 was fixed:
  7-Zip could not correctly extract some ZIP archives created with xz compression method.
- Some bugs were fixed.


20.02 alpha    2020-08-08
-------------------------
- The default number of LZMA2 chunks per solid block in 7z archive was increased to 64.
  It allows to increase the compression speed for big 7z archives, if there is a big number 
  of CPU cores and threads.
- The speed of PPMd compressing/decompressing was increased for 7z/ZIP/RAR archives.
- The new -ssp switch. If the switch -ssp is specified, 7-Zip doesn't allow the system 
  to modify "Last Access Time" property of source files for archiving and hashing operations. 
- Some bugs were fixed.


20.00 alpha    2020-02-06
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now supports new optional match finders for LZMA/LZMA2 compression: bt5 and hc5, 
  that can work faster than bt4 and hc4 match finders for the data with big redundancy.
- The compression ratio was improved for Fast and Fastest compression levels with the 
  following default settings:
   - Fastest level (-mx1) : hc5 match finder with 256 KB dictionary.
   - Fast    level (-mx3) : hc5 match finder with 4 MB dictionary.
- Minor speed optimizations in multithreaded LZMA/LZMA2 compression for Normal/Maximum/Ultra 
  compression levels.
- bzip2 decoding code was updated to support bzip2 archives, created by lbzip2 program.


19.02          2019-09-05
-------------------------
- Support for SHA-1/SHA-256 optimized code in 
  Sha1Opt.c, Sha256Opt.c, Sha256Opt.asm, Sha1Opt.asm.


19.00          2019-02-21
-------------------------
- Encryption strength for 7z archives was increased:
  the size of random initialization vector was increased from 64-bit to 128-bit,
  and the pseudo-random number generator was improved.
- Some bugs were fixed.


18.06          2018-12-30
-------------------------
- The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased by 3-10%,
  and there are minor changes in compression ratio.
- Some bugs were fixed.
- The bug in 7-Zip 18.02-18.05 was fixed:
  There was memory leak in multithreading xz decoder - XzDecMt_Decode(),
  if xz stream contains only one block.
- 7-Zip 18.02-18.05 used only one CPU thread for bz2 archive creation.
- The changes for MSVS compiler makefiles: 
   - the makefiles now use "PLATFORM" macroname with values (x64, x86, arm64)
     instead of "CPU" macroname with values (AMD64, ARM64).
   - the makefiles by default now use static version of the run-time library.


18.05          2018-04-30
-------------------------
- The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased 
    by 8% for fastest/fast compression levels and 
    by 3% for normal/maximum compression levels.
- Previous versions of 7-Zip could work incorrectly in "Large memory pages" mode in
  Windows 10 because of some BUG with "Large Pages" in Windows 10. 
  Now 7-Zip doesn't use "Large Pages" on Windows 10 up to revision 1709 (16299).


18.03 beta     2018-03-04
-------------------------
- Asm\x86\LzmaDecOpt.asm: new optimized LZMA decoder written in asm 
  for x64 with about 30% higher speed than main version of LZMA decoder written in C.
- The speed for single-thread LZMA/LZMA2 decoder written in C was increased by 3%.
- 7-Zip now can use multi-threading for 7z/LZMA2 decoding,
  if there are multiple independent data chunks in LZMA2 stream.
- 7-Zip now can use multi-threading for xz decoding,
  if there are multiple blocks in xz stream.


17.00 beta     2017-04-29
-------------------------
- NewHandler.h / NewHandler.cpp: 
    now it redefines operator new() only for old MSVC compilers (_MSC_VER < 1900).
- C/7zTypes.h : the names of variables in interface structures were changed (vt).
- Some bugs were fixed. 7-Zip could crash in some cases.
- Some internal changes in code.


16.02          2016-05-21
-------------------------
- The BUG in 16.00 - 16.01 was fixed:
  Split Handler (SplitHandler.cpp) returned incorrect 
  total size value (kpidSize) for split archives.


16.01          2016-05-19
-------------------------	
- Some bugs were fixed,
- Some internal changes to reduce the number of compiler warnings.


16.00          2016-05-10
-------------------------	
- 7-Zip now can extract multivolume ZIP archives (z01, z02, ... , zip).
- Some bugs were fixed,


15.12          2015-11-19
-------------------------	
- The BUG in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zDec.c : SzDecodeLzma2()
  7z decoder could mistakenly report about decoding error for some 7z archives
  that use LZMA2 compression method.
  The probability to get that mistaken decoding error report was about 
  one error per 16384 solid blocks for solid blocks larger than 16 KB (compressed size). 
- The BUG (in 9.26-15.11) in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zArcIn.c : SzReadHeader2()
  7z decoder worked incorrectly for 7z archives that contain 
  empty solid blocks, that can be placed to 7z archive, if some file is 
  unavailable for reading during archive creation.


15.09 beta     2015-10-16
-------------------------	
- The BUG in LZMA / LZMA2 encoding code was fixed.
  The BUG in LzFind.c::MatchFinder_ReadBlock() function.
  If input data size is larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size),
  the following code worked incorrectly:
  -  LZMA : LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() : LZMA encoding functions 
     for compressing from memory to memory. 
     That BUG is not related to LZMA encoder version that works via streams.
  -  LZMA2 : multi-threaded version of LZMA2 encoder worked incorrectly, if 
     default value of chunk size (CLzma2EncProps::blockSize) is changed 
     to value larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size).


9.38 beta      2015-01-03
-------------------------	
- The BUG in 9.31-9.37 was fixed:
  IArchiveGetRawProps interface was disabled for 7z archives.
- The BUG in 9.26-9.36 was fixed:
  Some code in CPP\7zip\Archive\7z\ worked correctly only under Windows.


9.36 beta      2014-12-26
-------------------------	
- The BUG in command line version was fixed:
  7-Zip created temporary archive in current folder during update archive
  operation, if -w{Path} switch was not specified. 
  The fixed 7-Zip creates temporary archive in folder that contains updated archive.
- The BUG in 9.33-9.35 was fixed:
  7-Zip silently ignored file reading errors during 7z or gz archive creation,
  and the created archive contained only part of file that was read before error.
  The fixed 7-Zip stops archive creation and it reports about error.


9.31           2012-10-31
-------------------------
- InBuffer.h : CInBuffer  uses ISequentialInStream  *_stream; instead of CMyComPtr<ISequentialInStream> 
  OutBuffer.h: COutBuffer uses ISequentialOutStream *_stream; instead of CMyComPtr<ISequentialOutStream> 
	

9.26           2011-04-11
-------------------------
- The BUG was fixed: multi-threaded ZIP stored file size that was at scan stage,
  So if the file was changed after scan, the Unpack Size field was incorrect
	

9.21           2011-04-11
-------------------------	
- New class FString for file names at file systems.
- Speed optimization in CRC code for big-endian CPUs.

-------------------------
- The bug was fixed:
   Utf16_To_Utf8 funstions in UTFConvert.cpp and 7zMain.c
   incorrectly converted surrogate characters (the code >= 0x10000) to UTF-8.


9.05           2009-07-05
-------------------------
- FileMapping.h::CFileMapping now returns WRes

  7-zip used swap4 filter instead (but id was swap2), so archives were incorrect.
  
4.61           2008-11-23
-------------------------
- Bug in ver. 4.58+ was fixed:
   7-Zip didn't use any -m* switch after -mtc, -mcl or -mcu for .zip archives. 
- Bug in .CAB code was fixed. 7-Zip didn't show some empty files,
  if .CAB archive contains more than one empty file.
   

4.59           2008-07-27
-------------------------
- Bug was fixed:
   LZMA Encoder in fast compression mode could access memory outside of 
   allocated range in some rare cases.
   

4.59 alpha     2008-05-30
-------------------------
- BUGS was fixed: 
    7zOut.cpp: 7-Zip incorrectly wrote size of property records in some cases.
    7zIn.cpp:  7-Zip incorrectly work with archive, containg archive properties.

4.58 alpha 9   2008-04-29
-------------------------
- BUG was fixed: 7-Zip showed incorrect timestamps in ISO files.


4.58 alpha 8   2008-04-15
-------------------------
- BUG in 4.58 alpha 5/6/7 was fixed:
    LZMA encoder worked incorrectly, if lp != 0.
- Unicode (UTF-8) support for filenames in .ZIP archives. Now there are 3 modes:
    1) Default mode: 7-Zip uses UTF-8, if the local code page doesn't contain required symbols.
    2) -mcu switch:  7-Zip uses UTF-8, if there are non-ASCII symbols.
    3) -mcl switch:  7-Zip uses local code page.
- Now it's possible to use -mSW- and -mSW+ switches instead of -mSW=off and -mSW=on  


4.58 alpha 7   2008-04-08
-------------------------
- BUG was fixed: BZip2Encoder and BZip2Decoder used CEvent objects without 
  creating, when BZip2 code was called with one thread (with -mmt1 switch or with 
  default switches on single thread CPU).
- .lzma support.
- RPM and NSIS support was improved.
- LZMA now stores only (2 << n) or (3 << n) dictionary size value to LZMA properties.


4.58 alpha 6   2008-03-27
-------------------------
- NTFS time extra in ZIP.
- New item property - kpidTimeType - VT_UI4 (0 - NTFS, 1 - Unix, 2 - DOS).
- Static CRC table is not required now for Lzma Encoder (in Lz MatchFinder).


4.58 alpha 5   2008-03-19
-------------------------
- Creation time (-mtc switch) for .7z archives
- LZMA encoder was converted to ANSI-C


4.58 alpha 3   2008-02-25
-------------------------
- Speed optimizations for LZMA decoding. Now it uses C code instead of C++.
- 7-Zip now has 128 MB dictionary limit for 32-bit version:
  It's for speed optimization: kNumLogBits = 9 + sizeof(size_t) / 2;
- TAR: 'D' link flag support.
- 7-Zip now can unpack multivolume RAR archives created with 
  "old style volume names" scheme (-vn switch) and names *.001, *.002, ...
- Fixed bugs:
  - 7-Zip FM could not copy / move files to root network folders like \\COMPNAME\FOLDERNAME\
    In case of move it removed original files.
  - SFX-WIN: if there are errors, it still could return 0.
  - ZIP (.XPS file) isZip64 && thisDiskNumber16 == 0xFFFF.
  - ZIP name updating:
      If zip file contains extra field and you try to change properties of files,
      7-zip tries to delete all extra fileds (except for WzAES).
      And that code could hang.
  -  7-Zip GUI didn't suggest BZip2 dictionary size used in previous run.
  -  If creation time stamp was included in .RAR archive, 7-zip used creation time stamp 
     as modification time stamp.
