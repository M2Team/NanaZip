# NanaZip - Privacy Policy

## Information collected

NanaZip does not collect any information. However it does provide you access to 
files and folders on your file system. Additionally, the Windows Store and 
Windows App Host collect data on usage, for example, who bought/used the app 
and crash reports. If you open any files or links in the app that go to other
websites you will need to look at their privacy policy.

## Sponsored edition

Due to the Microsoft Store Licensing API implementation, you will find NanaZip
will try to access the Internet beginning with NanaZip 3.0 because NanaZip
needs to use that to check the Sponsor Edition addon licensing status.

For optimizing the user experience, NanaZip will only check the Sponsor 
Edition addon licensing status at the first time your launch NanaZip File
Manager. You can click the sponsor button if you want to refresh the status
after you have purchased or redeemed the Sponsor Edition addon.
 
## Use of information

No other data is collected or shared online. We reserve the right to 
make changes to this policy. Any changes to this policy will be updated.
