**NanaZip 3.0 (3.0.996.0)**

- Notes
  - NanaZip 3.0 and onwards will have two distribution flavors called NanaZip
    and NanaZip Classic. But NanaZip 3.0 does not have the Classic flavor yet
    because it's not ready. Read
    https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip#differences-between-nanazip-and-nanazip-classic
    for more information.
  - The 32-bit x86 support for NanaZip packaged version is removed because
    supported 32-bit x86 Windows versions don't support running on 32-bit
    only x86 processors.
  - NanaZip 3.0 and onwards will have NanaZip Sponsor Edition. Read
    https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/SponsorEdition.md
    for more information.

    https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/issues/398 for more information.

      decoder for NanaZip.Core project.
    - Remove 7-Zip mainline XXH64 Hash handler for NanaZip.Core because we
