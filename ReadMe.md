## Download and Installation

Here are some available installation methods for NanaZip.

### Microsoft Store

This is the recommended way to install NanaZip.

Search and install `NanaZip` in Windows Store for stable release, and `NanaZip
Preview` for preview release.

Also, you can also click the Microsoft Store link you needed.

- [NanaZip](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N8G7TSCL18R)
- [NanaZip Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NZL0LRP1BNL)

### MSIX Package

You also can download the MSIX Package in 
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/releases).

After you have downloaded the MSIX Package, you can double click to install it,
or you can execute the following command in the Command Prompt which is run as the Administrator.

> PowerShell -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass Add-AppxPackage -DeferRegistrationWhenPackagesAreInUse -ForceUpdateFromAnyVersion -Path `The path of the MSIX package`

P.S. All needed dependencies are included in the MSIX Package of NanaZip 
because we known that it's very difficult for users who do not have access to 
the store to get our dependency packages, and we want to be robust and 
deployable everywhere.

## Known issues

- If you can't find NanaZip in the context menu, please restart all File 
  Explorer processes via Task Manager.
- Due to the issues in Desktop Bridge file system virtualization, you are 
  unable to use NanaZip in the Safe Mode of Windows.
- Due to the policy from Microsoft Store, NanaZip is unable to disable Desktop 
  Bridge file system virtualization, so the file operations in 
  `%UserProfile%/AppData` will be redirected in Windows 10, and file operations
  in directories other than `Local`, `LocalLow` and `Roaming` in 
  `%UserProfile%/AppData` will still be redirected in Windows 11.
- Due to the Microsoft Store limitations, NanaZip 1.2 and later won't support 
  languages not mentioned in 
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/supported-languages.

## Development Roadmap

- 1.0 (December 8, 2021)
  - [x] Modernize the build toolchain with MSBuild for using MSIX packaging and
        parallel compilation support.
  - [x] Use [VC-LTL 5.x](https://github.com/Chuyu-Team/VC-LTL5) toolchain to 
        make the binary size even smaller than the official 7-Zip because we
        can use ucrtbase.dll directly and the optimizations from modern compile
        toolchain.
  - [x] Add the context menu support in Windows 10/11 File Explorer.
  - [x] New icons and minor UI tweaks.
  - [x] Merge NSIS script decompiling support from 
        [7-Zip NSIS branch](https://github.com/myfreeer/7z-build-nsis).
        (Suggested by alanfox2000.)
  - [x] Provide 7-Zip execution alias for helping users to migrate to NanaZip. 
        (Suggested by AndromedaMelody.)
  - [x] Add support for Brotli, Fast-LZMA2, Lizard, LZ4, LZ5 and Zstandard
        from [7-Zip ZS branch](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd). (Suggested
        by fcharlie.)
- 1.1 (March 17, 2022)

- 1.2 (May 11, 2022)
  - [x] Add Per-Monitor DPI-Aware support for Self Extracting Executables.
  - [x] Modernize the i18n implementation and migrate language files from 
        `.txt`  to `.resw`. (Suggested by Maicol Battistini.)
  - [x] Add i18n support for Self Extracting Executables.
- 2.x Series (2023 Q3)
  - [ ] Add the UI stack based on XAML Islands which is used in NanaZip.
  - [ ] Modernize the UI with XAML Islands with the Windows 11 control style, 
        Mica material, dark and light mode support.
  - [ ] Full High DPI and Accessibility support in all UI components.
  - [ ] Migrate configurations from registry to json. (Suggested by 
        AndromedaMelody.)

  - [ ] Try to design the new UI layout. (Suggested by wangwenx190.)
  - [ ] Try to add option for using Windows Imaging API (WIMGAPI) backend to 
        make better creation and extraction support for wim archives, also add 
        creation and extraction support for esd archives.
  - [ ] Try to add pri archive extracting support.
  - [ ] Try to add smart extraction.
  - [ ] Try to add language encoding switching support for file names in File
        Manager. (Suggested by 刘泪 and zjkmxy.)
  - [ ] Try to add deleting source after archiving support. (Suggested by 
        OrionGrant.)
  - [ ] Try to add an option when extracting an archive to open the folder 
        where you extracted the files, like WinRAR. (Suggested by maicol07.)
  - [ ] Try to add ISO creation support.
- 5.x Series (2025 Q3)
  - Currently no new feature plans for this series.
- Unpredictable Future Series (T.B.D.)
  - [ ] Try to create a new archive file format optimized for software 
        distribution and image backup and restore.
    - [ ] Keeping metadata provided by file system.
    - [ ] File referencing support.
    - [ ] Integrity verification support.
    - [ ] Differential support.
    - [ ] Recovery record support.
    - [ ] Provide lightweight SDK for authoring and consuming.
  - [ ] Try to contribute recovery record support for 7z archives to 7-Zip 
        mainline. (Suggested by SakuraNeko.)
  - [ ] Try to port NanaZip to Linux.
    - [ ] Try to port MegaUI (an developing lightweight UI framework created by
          mingkuang, under internal developing at the current stage, will be 
          open source if the work has done) framework to Linux.
    - [ ] Try to create MinLin (a.k.a. Minimum Linux, a distro intended for 
          helping publish distroless binaries and provide some Windows API 
          functions as static libraries for having a lightweight platform 
          abstraction layer) project because I think NanaZip should support
          distroless environment for reducing time wasting for compiling for
          different distros.
  - [ ] After porting NanaZip to Linux, accept contributions from community 
        folks for other POSIX platforms (e.g. FreeBSD) and macOS support.
  - [ ] Try to add extension for Windows File Explorer for give user immersive 
        experience like builtin zip file support in Windows. (Suggested by 
        SakuraNeko and shuax.)
